# Seantral Project Status

## What's Working

### API Layer (FastAPI)
- ✅ Basic API server running successfully
- ✅ `/` endpoint returning welcome message
- ✅ `/v1/timeseries` endpoint generating sample time series data
- ✅ `/v1/alerts` endpoint returning sample alerts
- ✅ Python test client confirming API functionality

### Data Pipeline Package
- ✅ Package structure set up correctly
- ✅ Module for Copernicus Marine data ingest (placeholder)
- ✅ Module for NOAA NDBC buoy data ingest (placeholder)
- ✅ Parquet storage utility tested and working
- ✅ Installable via pip in development mode

### Web Frontend
- ✅ Next.js application running successfully
- ✅ Basic UI with home page and dashboard implemented
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling configured and working
- ✅ MapLibre integration for interactive maps
- ✅ Time series charts with Plotly
- ✅ API client for data fetching
- ⚠️ React component type definitions need improvement
- ⚠️ Workspace dependencies still need troubleshooting

### Project Structure
- ✅ Monorepo organized with apps/ and packages/ directories
- ✅ Separation of concerns between UI, API, and data pipeline components
- ✅ Documentation (README, architecture diagrams, etc.)
- ✅ Docker configurations for containerization
- ✅ CI/CD workflows defined for GitHub Actions

## What Needs Work

### Integration Points
- ✅ Connecting web frontend to API
- ⚠️ Integrating with Supabase for authentication
- ⚠️ Interactive map features (selecting locations, displaying data points)

### Testing
- ⚠️ End-to-end tests with Cypress
- ⚠️ Unit tests for UI components
- ⚠️ More comprehensive tests for API endpoints
- ⚠️ More comprehensive tests for data pipeline

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Core Frontend Features**:
   - ✅ Add MapLibre map in the dashboard
   - ✅ Connect to the API for time series data
   - ✅ Create interactive chart component with Plotly
   - Add interactive map markers and data selection

2. **Integrate with Backend**:
   - ✅ Set up API client in the web app
   - ✅ Display real data from FastAPI endpoints
   - Implement authentication with Supabase

3. **Enhance Testing**:
   - Add more unit tests for all components
   - Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing

4. **Refine Documentation**:
   - Update diagrams to reflect actual implementation
   - Add more detailed usage examples

5. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Test Docker containers
   - Set up continuous deployment pipelines
